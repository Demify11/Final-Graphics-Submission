You are a criminal who
has been involved in various crimes and your only hope is to escape the police in your BMW M3.
The general idea is the player needs to survive the police chase as long as possible. The longer
the player lasts the higher the score they get.
As time progresses in the game the police car gets faster and faster and the only way to speed
up is to collect the bright diamonds, so keep collecting them to keep your speed faster than the
police car, if he catches up to you it's game over. Watch out so that you don't hit the rocks
because they will slow you down and the police car will catch up easier.
